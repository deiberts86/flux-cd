# FluxCD HomeLab Rancher Cluster
Home lab is now leveraging SUSE Harvester HCI (Hyper Converged Infrastructure) that replaced my ESX-I host I had. KubeVirt is used under the hood on top of RKE2. Virtual machines are containerized and deployed ontop of Kubernetes (K8s).

## Harvester With FluxCD
The concept to pair Harvester with FluxCD is to control components on Harvester with DevOps. Since this is a home lab, I'm not going to over complicate the setup for my personal use. However, I will incorporate common skus that are typically seen out in the real world. There might be instances where I host local DevSecOps related content but that will be referenced in another project.

- FUTURE plans:
  - Install Core components with FluxCD
    - Cert Manager
    - Container Registry with Proxy-Cache
    - OIDC
    - Object Storage
    - Virtual Routers
    - vCluster with Rancher MCM
    - Gitlab or Gitea

### Setup
Pre-Requisite:
- You will need to setup Harvester HCI, note this will take some time to do this correctly based on your own requirements.
  - The requirements and setup are found [HERE](https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5/)
  - Plan your networking layout (I.E, if you're going to have logical vlans, build them now on your router / switching environment)
- Create a bastion host on your Harvester cluster once online
  - If you logically separated your vlans, ensure it lives in the management vlan
- Get your Harvester `kubeconfig` while logged in your bastion host
  - copy it to a save location
  - ensure you have `kubectl` and `fluxcli` installed
    ```sh
    # Install kubectl
    curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
    # Install fluxcli
    curl -s https://fluxcd.io/install.sh | sudo bash
    ```

Setup FluxCD:
```sh
# Bootstrap
export GITHUB_OWNER=<name>
export GITHUB_BRANCH=<branch-name>
export GITHUB_REPO=<your-repo-name>
export GITHUB_PATH=<your-path-in-repo>
# Paste your created Github token when it goes to the next line and press enter. This prevents it being stored in history.
read -s GITHUB_TOKEN
flux bootstrap github --owner=$GITHUB_OWNER --repository=$GITHUB_REPO   --branch=$GITHUB_BRANCH --path=$GITHUB_PATH --token-auth
```

If done correctly, you should see the following from your bastion host CLI:
```sh
✔ helm-controller: deployment ready
✔ kustomize-controller: deployment ready
✔ notification-controller: deployment ready
✔ source-controller: deployment ready
✔ all components are healthy
```
